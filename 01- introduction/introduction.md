# HTML Tutorial
## What is HTML?

HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a programming language which describes the structure of content on a web page.

This is done through the creation of ```.html``` files, or other supported file type such as ```.aspx```.

Inside this file, various tags can be used to help define the content contained within such as:

```html
<div>CONTENT</div>
<p>CONTENT</p>
<span>CONTENT</span>
```
